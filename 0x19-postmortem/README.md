# Postmortem

Upon the release of ALX's System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19,
approximately 06:00 West African Time (WAT) here in Nigeria, an outage occurred on an isolated
Ubuntu 14.04 container running an Apache web server. GET requests on the server led to
`500 Internal Server Error`'s, when the expected response was an HTML file defining a
simple Holberton WordPress site.
