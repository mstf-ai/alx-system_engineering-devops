User Access Scenario:

    User Request:
        A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com securely.

Infrastructure Components:

    Server 1 (Web Server):
        Hosts Nginx, handles HTTP and redirects to HTTPS.
        Serves static content and encrypts traffic using SSL.

    Server 2 (Application Server):
        Executes dynamic code of the website.
        Collaborates with the web server to process dynamic content.

    Server 3 (Database):
        MySQL database server, part of a Primary-Replica cluster for scalability and redundancy.

    Firewalls (3):
        Placed between servers and the internet, control incoming and outgoing traffic.
        Enhance security by filtering and monitoring network traffic.

    Load Balancer (HAProxy):
        Distributes traffic among servers for load balancing.
        Terminates SSL, reducing the load on individual servers and providing a centralized point for SSL termination.

    SSL Certificate:
        Enables HTTPS to encrypt traffic between users and the website.
        Boosts security by preventing eavesdropping and data tampering.

    Monitoring Clients (3):
        Data collectors for monitoring services like Sumo Logic.
        Collect metrics, logs, and performance data for analysis.

Specifics of the Infrastructure:

    Additional Elements:
        Firewalls: Added for enhanced security. They filter and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic, protecting the infrastructure from unauthorized access and potential threats.
        SSL Certificate: Implemented to enable HTTPS, ensuring secure communication between users and the website.
        Monitoring Clients: Deployed to collect and analyze data for proactive issue detection and performance optimization.

    Firewalls:
        Control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
        Help prevent unauthorized access, protect against malicious activities, and ensure network security.

    HTTPS Traffic:
        Why: Encrypts data during transmission, protecting sensitive user information from eavesdropping and tampering.
        SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Reduces the processing load on individual servers, centralizing SSL termination for improved efficiency.

    Monitoring:
        Purpose: Proactively identify performance issues, security threats, and potential failures.
        Data Collection: Monitoring clients collect metrics, logs, and other relevant data from servers and services, providing insights for optimization and troubleshooting.

    Monitoring Tool Data Collection (e.g., Sumo Logic):
        Metrics: Collects performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and response times.
        Logs: Gathers logs for analysis, aiding in the identification of issues and security incidents.

    Monitoring Web Server QPS:
        Steps:
            Configure monitoring tool to collect metrics related to the web server's request per second (QPS).
            Analyze QPS metrics to identify patterns, spikes, or anomalies.
            Adjust server resources or scale horizontally if needed to handle increased QPS.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

    Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:
        Issue: While it offloads SSL processing, it can expose decrypted traffic within the internal network.
        Solution: Implement end-to-end encryption by using SSL/TLS between the load balancer and the web server.

    Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
        Issue: If the single MySQL server fails, it leads to a write availability issue.
        Solution: Implement a Primary-Replica cluster with multiple MySQL servers capable of accepting writes to enhance reliability and availability.

    Identical Components on Servers:
        Issue: Uniformity in components may lead to a single point of failure if a common component fails.
        Solution: Introduce diversity, redundancy, or load balancing in critical components such as web servers, application servers, and databases to mitigate risks associated with failures.
