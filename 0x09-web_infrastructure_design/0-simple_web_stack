Web Infrastructure Design: Single Server with LAMP Stack
User Access Scenario:

    User Request:
        A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

Infrastructure Components:

    Server (8.8.8.8):
        A physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure.

    Domain Name:
        Domain: foobar.com
        DNS Record: www.foobar.com points to the server IP (8.8.8.8)

    Web Server (Nginx):
        Responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static content.
        Listens for incoming requests on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

    Application Server:
        Executes the dynamic code of the website.
        Interacts with the web server to process dynamic content.

    Application Files (Code Base):
        Contains the website's code, including HTML, CSS, and dynamic server-side code.

    Database (MySQL):
        Stores and retrieves data for the website.
        Application server communicates with the database for dynamic content.

Specifics of the Infrastructure:

    Server:
        A physical or virtual machine responsible for hosting the entire web infrastructure.
        It stores the application files, hosts the web server, and manages the database.

    Domain Name:
        Acts as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
        Users access the website using www.foobar.com instead of the server's IP.

    DNS Record (www):
        A CNAME (Canonical Name) record that specifies www.foobar.com as an alias for foobar.com.
        It points to the server's IP, allowing users to reach the website using www.foobar.com.

    Web Server:
        Nginx handles HTTP requests, serves static files, and manages connections.
        Acts as the initial point of contact for users accessing the website.

    Application Server:
        Executes dynamic code, communicates with the database, and generates dynamic content.
        Collaborates with the web server to deliver a complete web page to the user.

    Database:
        MySQL stores and retrieves data used by the website.
        The application server interacts with the database to provide dynamic content.

    Communication:
        Communication with the user's computer is via HTTP or HTTPS.
        The web server responds to user requests and collaborates with the application server to generate dynamic content.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

    Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
        The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If it fails, the website becomes inaccessible.
        Redundancy measures such as load balancing or failover mechanisms are needed to mitigate this risk.

    Downtime During Maintenance:
        Deploying new code may require restarting the web server, causing temporary downtime.
        Implementing a rolling deployment strategy or utilizing a redundant server can minimize downtime.

    Scaling Challenges:
        The infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic.
        Implementing load balancing and considering vertical or horizontal scaling strategies can address scalability concerns.
