# Specifics of the Infrastructure:

   * Additional Server (Server 4):
        Why: Added to increase infrastructure capacity and redundancy.
        Benefits:
            Distributes the load, improving overall performance.
            Acts as a backup if other servers fail, ensuring high availability.

   * Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy):
        Why: Configured as a cluster for load balancing and high availability.
        Benefits:
            Distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers.
            Ensures continuous service even if one load balancer instance fails.
            Enhances scalability by accommodating additional servers.

   * Split Components (Web Server, Application Server, Database):
        Why: Separation for improved scalability, maintainability, and security.
        Benefits:
            Web Server: Focuses on serving static content and handling SSL encryption.
            Application Server: Executes dynamic code and collaborates with the web server.
            Database: Part of a Primary-Replica cluster for database scalability and redundancy.
            Isolation of components enables easier scaling, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

### Summary:

The addition of an extra server, clustering the load balancer, and splitting components across different servers contribute to a more robust, scalable, and reliable web infrastructure. These enhancements improve the overall performance, availability, and maintainability of the system. The infrastructure is now better equipped to handle increased traffic, mitigate failures, and provide a seamless experience for users accessing www.foobar.com.
